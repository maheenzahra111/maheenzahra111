ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maheen Zahra
ðŸŽ“ MSc Data Science student at the University of Manchester  
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about turning raw data into insights through EDA, visualization, and applied machine learning.

ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Building deep learning models for customer churn and stock price prediction using LSTM and random forests.  
- Creating visual storytelling dashboards to uncover patterns in telecom and e-commerce datasets.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- Transformer architectures, large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
- Enhancing my NLP and deep learning skills to better solve real-world problems.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

- AI and NLP-based projects using LLMs, RAG and time-series forecasting.  
- EDA-rich projects focused on storytelling and deriving business insights through data.
- Innovative data science solutions in fintech, e-commerce, or marketing.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:

- Fine-tuning transformer models for practical use cases in finance and tech.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Visualization  
- Deep Learning & NLP  
- Predictive Analytics & ML Models  
- Communicating data insights to stakeholders
